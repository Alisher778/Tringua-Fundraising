Hi every one my name is Mahamadou KOITA .Back home in my  country MALI I got a BA degree  in CS since 2009. after I came in US in 2010. Right now I am drivng Taxi to make living. Since I came in US I didn,t practice at all anything in the cs field; that is why I chose  the PWID at NYCDA to catch up and  update my level. so I can change carreer.

I am building a website for my African Immigrant comminity called Tringua fundraising because  Tringua is the name of my small town in MALI where all members come from.
					
						Goals of the fundraising

 Funeral:
  Financing the funeral expenses of each member who died here in US and to carry the corp of the defunt from US to MALI.

  Immigration Lawyer:
  Providing a lawyer to anyone who  get arrested by the ICE(Immigration and Customs Enforcement).

                       Why I am building this website?

 It design for mobile device because every body uses mobile phone.                        

I am building this website for two main reasons :

fist: this website  is going to make the fundraising for credentiel ,transparent and coherent.Every one likes to know and see where their fundraising are going.
so this website is going to give the privilege to each member to pay and check all current statment of the fundraising online.

secondly: this website is going to give the privilege to every body  to post and receive  an event alert of the fundraising at the same time.
